# web3.fs
Functional library for interacting with Web3 facilities

### Motivation

Dissatisfaction with existing solutions for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM chains. Hope to add support for Substrate-based chains later.

### Progress

Planning stages, fewer than 1000 lines written.

### Deps and Reqs

Pulling in Nethereum.Hex and Nethereum.ABI because I don't want to mess with that stuff.
Writing in .Net 6

First code coming soon.

### Code of Conduct

I'm a dictator and I rule with an iron fist. I expressly reject CoCs.
