# web3.fs
Functional library for interacting with Web3 facilities

### Motivation

Dissatisfaction with existing solutions for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM chains. Hope to add support for Substrate-based chains later.

### Progress

Basic functionality cobbled in. Not ready for use. It will probably explode, or be silly.

### Deps and Reqs

Removed Nethereum deps (for now). 
FSharp.Data
FSharp.Json
Writing in .Net 6

First code coming soon.

### Code of Conduct

I'm a dictator and I rule with an iron fist. I explicitly reject CoCs.
